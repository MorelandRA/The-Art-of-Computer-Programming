An algorithm has 5 important features:

Finiteness
An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps
A procedure that has all of the characteristics of an algorithm except that it
possibly lacks finiteness is called a computational method
All algorithms are computational methods

Definiteness
Each step of an algorithm must be precisely defined and unambiguous. 
An expression of a computational method in a computer language is called
a program

Input
An algorithm has zero or more inputs

Output
An algorithm has one or more outputs

Effectiveness
An algorithm is expected to be effective; all operations should be basic
enough to be done in a finite length of time by someone using pencil and paper
An algorithm for finding the greatest common denominator is not
"Step one: find the greatest common denominator" because this is not a basic
step.
