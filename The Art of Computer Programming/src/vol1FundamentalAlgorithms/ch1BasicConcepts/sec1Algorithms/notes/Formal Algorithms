In these notes, I'll be using O to represent capital omega, as it's written
in the book

Let a computational method be defined as (Q,I,O,f) where
Q represents the states of computation
I represents the input
O represents the output
f represents a computational rule

Additionally, 
Sets I and O are subsets of Q
f maps Q onto Q
f(q) = q for all q in the set of O (If a solution is an output, 
	it should not change)

Each input x in the set I defines a computational sequence such that
x0 = x
xk+1 = f(xk) for all k >= 0

The computational sequence will terminate in k steps if k is the least value
where xk is in omega

Computational sequences might not end. Ones that terminate in a finite number
of steps for all x in I are called algorithms.
