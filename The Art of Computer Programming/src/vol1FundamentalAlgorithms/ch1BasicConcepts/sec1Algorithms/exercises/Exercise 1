The text showed how to interchange the values of variables m and n, using the 
replacement notation, by setting t <- m, m <- n, n <- t. Show how the values
of four variables (a,b,c,d) can e rearranged to (b,c,d,a) by a sequence of
replacements. In other words, the new value of a is to be the original value
of b, etc. Try to use the minimum number of replacements.

t <- a
a <- b
b <- c
c <- d
d <- t
