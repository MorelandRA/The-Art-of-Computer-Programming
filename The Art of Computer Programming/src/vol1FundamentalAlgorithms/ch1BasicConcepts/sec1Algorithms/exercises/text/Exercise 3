Change Algorithm E (for the sake of efficiency) so that all trivial 
replacement operations such as "m <- n" are avoided. Write this new
algorithm in the style of Algorithm E, and call it Algorithm F

A coded version is found in exercises/code/AlgorithmF.java

Algorithm F (Euclid's Algorithm). Given two positive integers m and n, find
their greatest common denominator, that is, the largest positive integer that
evenly divides both m and n.

F1. [Find remainder] Divide m by n and let m be the remainder.
F2. [Is it zero?] if m = 0, the algorithm terminates; n is the answer.
F3. [Find remainder] Divide n by m and let n be the remainder.
F4. [Is it zero?] if n = 0, the algorithm terminates; m is the answer.
F5. [Repeat] go back to step F1. |
