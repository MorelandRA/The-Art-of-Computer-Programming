What is the greatest common divisor of 2166 and 6099?

Using the method in Exercise 3:

M = 6099, N = 2166
M <- (6099%2166 = 1767)
M = 1767, N = 2166
N <- (2166%1767 = 399)
M = 1767, N = 399
M <- (1767%399 = 171)
M = 171, N = 399
N <- (399%171 = 57)
M = 171, N = 57
171%57 = 0

The GCD of 2166 and 6099 is 57.
