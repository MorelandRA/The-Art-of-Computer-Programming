Show that the "Procedure for Reading This Set of Books" that appears after
the preface actually fails to be a genuine algorithm on at least three of
our five counts! Also mention some differences in format between it and
Algorithm E.

Finiteness: This computational method loops forever, and is not finite

Definiteness: Many steps are ambiguous. What makes a chapter "interesting"? 
	What is "mathematically inclined"?
	
Input: There are no inputs, but that's okay

Output: There are no outputs, because the computational method never ends

Effectiveness: Many steps are too complicated. "Work the recommended exercises
	in this section in accordance with the hints given in the Notes on the 
	Exercises", "report errors to the author".
	
Differences in format include:
The steps are not identified by a letter and a number such as "E1"
Steps are not summarized in brackets
The computational method does not end in a thick bar |
