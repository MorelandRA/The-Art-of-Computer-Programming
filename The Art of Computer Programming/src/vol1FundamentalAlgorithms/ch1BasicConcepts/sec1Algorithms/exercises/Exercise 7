Let Um be the average number of times that step E1 is executed in Algorithm E,
if m is known and n is allowed to range over all positive integers. Show that
Um is well defined. Is Um in any way related to Tm?

Tm is described in exercise 6

There are an infinite number of cases where n>m (and only a finite number where 
n<m) so the infinite portion will take up the entirety of the average

For all of these cases, the first step will be to swap m and n, since
m%n = m when n>m

Once M and N are flipped, we are now looking at the case where n is known and
m is allowed to range over all positive integers (technically, all integers > n)

The case described above is the same as Tm

Therefore, Um = Tm+1.
