Notes on Section 2, Mathematical Preliminaries

This section is focused on teaching the mathematical notations and algebraic formulas that
will be used later in the book.

Most of the math in this book can be completed by someone with a knowledge of college algebra,
and someone knowing basic calculus will be able to do almost all of the math that appears.

However, it does draw from nearly every branch of mathematics, including complex variable
theory, group theory, number theory, probability theory, and more.

The author recommends skimming this section, completing a few exercises in each subsection,
and referring back to it whenever the reader believes that studying it will be useful.
