Let P(n) be some statement about the integer n. Suppose we want to prove that 
P(n) is true
for any positive integer n. We could do this by proving

1. P(1) is true
2. If all of P(1), P(2), ..., P(n) are true, then P(n+1) is also true


For example, consider the following series of equations:

1 = 1^2
1+3 = 2^2
1+3+5 = 3^2
1+3+5+7 = 4^2

can be generalized to
1+3+...+(2n-1)=n^2

Let the equation above be represented by P(n).
To use proof by induction:

1. P(1) is true
	1 = 1^2
2. If all of P(1), P(2), ..., P(n) are true, then P(n+1) is also true
	Therefore P(n) is true
	1+3+...+(2n-1) + (2n+1) = n^2 + (2n+1) = (n+1)^2
	which proves that P(n+1) is also true.
	
Mathematical induction is different from scientific induction in that 
scientific induction is a guess based on observation of certain properties.
Mathematical induction is an actual proof. It is only inductive when deciding
what we actually need to prove.

In this book, induction will be used in the mathematical sense, not the
scientific sense.
