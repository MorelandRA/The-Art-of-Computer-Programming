With a, the proof that P(1) is true, and b, the proof that if al of P(1), 
P(2) ... P(n) are true then P(n+1) is also true, provided:

Algorithm I (Construct a proof). Given a positive integer n, this algorithm 
will output a proof that P(n) is true.
I1. [Prove P(1)] Set k <- 1, and, according to (a), output a proof of P(1).
I2. [k = n?] if k = n, terminate; the required proof has been output.
I3. [Prove P(k+1).] According to (b), output a proof that "If all of P(1),
	..., P(k) are true, then P(k+1) is true." Also output "We have already
	proved P(1), ..., P(k), hence P(k+1) is true."
I4. [Increase k.] Increase k by 1 and go to step I2. |

This is called proof by mathematical induction.
