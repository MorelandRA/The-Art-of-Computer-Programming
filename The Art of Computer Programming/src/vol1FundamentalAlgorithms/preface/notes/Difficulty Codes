30 is a moderate problem, may take 2+ hours of work to solve
40 is a very hard problem suitable for a college term project. Not trivial
50 is an unsolved research problem

Difficulty%5 = an estimate for how much time a problem will take to solve
A problem rated 24 will take longer to take than a problem rated 25, but
the problem rated 25 may take more creativity.

Problems rated 46 or higher are "open problems for future research, rated
according to how many different attacks they've resisted so far"

Some problems require math, and are marked with an M
Some problems require higher math, and are marked with an HM

"An "HM" designation does not necessarily imply difficulty"
