Prove that when n is an integer, n>2, the equation x^n + y^n = z^n has no
solution in positive integers x,y,z.

For cases n <= 2:

n=0
x^0 + y^0 = z^0
1 + 1 = 1
Always false

n=1
x^1 + y^1 = z^1
x + y = z
For any chosen x or y, there is always a unique value z that satisfies the
equation.

n=2 
x^2 + y^2 = z^2
The pythagorean theorem. Only for some value x and y will there be a value z 
that satisfies the equation.
